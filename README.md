We proposed a segmentation method based on SAM prior knowledge guidance strategy, and the above is a schematic diagram of integrating SAM prior knowledge.For detailed method introduction, please read the original article

## Requirements
Install from the ```requirements.txt``` using:
```angular2html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

*Note: If you have some problems with the code, the [issues](https://github.com/ThirteenYue/2MSPK-Net/issues) may help.*

### 1. Data Preparation
#### 1.1. GlaS and MoNuSeg Datasets
ðŸ”¥ The original data can be downloaded in following links:
* MoNuSeg Dataset - [Link (Original)](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/)
* TNBC Dataset - [Link (Original)](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/tnbc)

Then prepare the datasets in the following format for easy use of the code:
```angular2html
â”œâ”€â”€ Dataset
 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ MoNusg
 Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ test
 Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ boundary_priors
    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ images
    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ masks
 Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ seg_priors
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ train
 Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ boundary_priors
    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ images
    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ masks
 Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ seg_priors	
 Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ val
 Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ boundary_priors
    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ images
    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ masks
 Â Â  Â Â  Â Â    â””â”€â”€ seg_priors
```

### 2. Training
During the training process, the data were uniformly resized to 256Ã—256 pixels and data augmentation was applied, including affine transformation, random flipping, and random rotation. Gradient descent was performed using the Adam optimizer with \beta_1 set to 0.9 and \beta_2 set to 0.999. The initial learning rate was set to 1\times{10}^{-4}, and an adaptive learning rate decay strategy was employed. If the loss on the validation set did not decrease after every 20 epochs, the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 0.5. The batch size was set to 4, and the training was completed after 600 epochs. 


#### 2.2 Pre-training
We didn't use any pre-trained weights


### 3. Testing
We also added SAM prior area maps and contour maps to the test data set
*You can generate area maps and contour mapsarea and contour plots using SAM_prior.py
We will announce other test and visualization codes later
